Hi, I’m Lefteris Chatzismalis
I’m currently improving my knowledge on several programming languages(mainly Python and Kotlin) through lessons and practice on personal projects 
I’m looking to collaborate on anything that would give me the opportunity to extend my coding ability especially if the project is intriguing
My main interest would be to be able to participate in the creation of games as I find it very fulfilling to overcome difficulties and end up with a game that others will enjoy
