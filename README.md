Hi, my name is Lefteris Chatzismalis
I am finishing my studies at the Univercity of Mathematics in Athens.

I have practiced programming on Java,Python and Kotlin mainly by working on projects on my own, viewing lessons and reading from several sources.

Currently I am working mainly with Kotlin and Python and developing an app as a project I started for experience with developing applications on Android(and for personal use)

My Goal would be to be able to participate in the creation of games as I find it very fulfilling to create a game that others and I myself will enjoy, also I like the challenge and problem solving involved in the process
